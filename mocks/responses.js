      "There is no information in the provided context that suggests TV Globo published any articles or broadcast segments criticizing Pope Francis for not wearing a mask [no citation available]. However, regarding CNN, there is no direct evidence of criticism from them either, but an artificial intelligence-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat was reported by CNN as going viral, though this is unrelated to mask-wearing [19]. The only mention related to criticism for not wearing a mask comes from other sources such as TheGuardian.com [18], which scolded Pope Francis for hardly wearing a mask.",

      'According to the context, on June 23, all regions in Italy, except one, were classified as "zonas brancas," indicating low circulation of the coronavirus [2]. In the Vatican, visitors were required to respect social distancing, wear masks, and have their temperature checked [2]. However, it is mentioned that the Vatican follows the health guidelines of Italy, and on June 23, the Italian government announced that it would suspend the obligation to wear masks outdoors starting from June 28 [2].\n\nRegarding Pope Francis\' vaccination status, it is confirmed that he was fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since February 2021 [2].\n\nAs for the specific date when Pope Francis was observed greeting the faithful without a mask, the context does not provide an exact date, but it mentions an incident where he greeted pilgrims without a mask during his weekly general audience on October 28, 2020 [5], and another instance where he was seen without a mask while joking with prelates and kissing the hands of newly ordained priests [15]. However, these instances do not necessarily correspond to the exact date mentioned in the question.',

    system:
      "The video shared by President Jair Bolsonaro of Pope Francis greeting the faithful without a mask was not edited, as it is confirmed that the images were indeed from June 23, 2021, and can be verified by watching the official recording of the audience published on the Vatican's YouTube channel [1]. The setting of the original footage was the pátio de São Dâmaso, no Vaticano, during an audience where Pope Francis greeted and blessed the faithful [1]. There is no indication in the provided context that the video was taken out of its original context.",
